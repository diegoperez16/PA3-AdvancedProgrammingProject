# PA3: Fractals Diego-Glorián
This project is based on openFrameworks.
This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course ICOM4015/CIIC4010.
The purpose of this project is to help the student create practical programming skills by implementing changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class such as the creation and implementation of abstract classes, and recursion.


## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Build & Run the project

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p><b><i>USE THE MAIN BRANCH</b></i></p>

<b>Phase 1 Explanation</b>
<p>+ Levels: Pressing <code>"Left arrow"</code> decreases the depth of recursion and <code>"Right arrow"</code> increases the depth of recursion. <i>(Partner A)</i></p>
<p>+ Coloring Levels: Each level of recursion have a different color. <i>(Partner A)</i> </p>

<b>Phase 2 Explanation</b>
<p>+ Fractal: Creation of an interface called Factal. <i>(Partner B)</i> </p>
<p>+ Abstract Fractal: Creation of an abstract class called AbstractFractal. <i>(Partner B)</i></p>
<p>+ Edit Tree Fractal: Added two more Tree fractals that are half the size of the larger existing one. They will not touch. <i>(Partner A & B)</i></p>
<p>+ Complete Sierpinski: Completed the Sierpinski's triangle fractal. Now it contains three recursive calls instead of two. <i>(Partner B)</i></p>

<b>Phase 3 Explanation</b>
<p>+ Refractor Fractals: Area 1 has a friend. Pressing <code>"e"</code> the player can interact with his new friend, but will not fight, they are allies. <i>(Partner A)</i></p>
<p>+New Fractal: This new fractal is inspired by a tetra fractal, but we call it tetra circle. <i>(Partner A)</i></p>
<p>+ Animation: Pressing <code>"Space bar"</code> will activate the animation by settting the recursion level to 1.Then it will increase the levels of recursion of the fractal level by level slowly until it completes the fractal. You can cancel the animation by pressing the <code>"Space bar"</code> again.<i>(Partner A)</i></p>

<b>Bonus</b>
<p>+ Two new fractals: Square Fractal and Ellipse Fractal. Press <code>"7"</code> to acces the square fractal & <code>"8"</code> to access the ellipse fractal. <i>(Partner B)</i></p>
